# FL Studio MIDI Script for Novation Launchkey MK3

This is a work in progress and doesn't add any useful features yet.

To install, refer to [FL Studio's Midi Scripting Docs](https://www.image-line.com/fl-studio-learning/fl-studio-online-manual/html/midi_scripting.htm)

Please note that currently the included python 3.6.3 standard library must be installed to FL Studio's built-in python interpreter. This is to add support for the iso8859_2 string encoding. Future versions won't require this.
