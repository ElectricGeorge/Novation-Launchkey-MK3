## Important Note
I am often very busy, so these early stages of development will be slow. The code is very small as of now. Do not create pull requests that completely change the project structure. Open an issue to leave suggestions. 

## Rules
* Be excellent to each other.
* Object-oriented programming is bad and code that tries to fit this paradigm will be rejected. Creating classes/data types when they make sense are fine.
* Avoid spaghetti code. Believe it or not, managing code is a lot easier without object-oriented programming.
* Proprietary code is not allowed. I don't want to worry about legal issues and this software will stay free for both the user and the developer.
* The GNU GPL and other copyleft licenses are not really free. Permissive licenses are ok.
* Code without an accepted license won't be merged. Transferring the ownership of a contribution is also an option, but not encouraged.
